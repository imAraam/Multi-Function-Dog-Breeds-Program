## Assignment Description

Apply the test-driven development approach to the development of functional-style code written
in the Haskell programming language. Choose any algorithm/application to
develop, it should be complex enough that it can be broken down into multiple functions
each requiring multiple tests during the test-driven development process. Utilise Haskell libraries that provide unit-testing tools.
